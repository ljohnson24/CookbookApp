COMP 488 – Rapid App Development using .NET
Professor: Karim Kabani
Project Proposal
Project Name: Simple Cooking (Cooking recipe management app)


Members: Edin Kalezic, Lashaun Johnson, Keyti Toromanova


Project Abstract: We are looking to create an app where people can share recipes and upload pictures to accompany the recipe or even create a picture step by step process. The recipes will be shown in general, but those users who wish to upload will have to log in. 


Project Description: A simple app where users upload recipe information along with visuals (pictures, drawings, etc.) A registration page will be created so that users wishing to upload recipes or visuals can do so, otherwise the recipes will be available for all to see without registration. This basically is a share form application where people will be sharing information that is stored and accessed on a secure database.The app will feature different categories, such as 'breakfast', 'lunch', 'dinner', 'vegetarian food', etc? Users will also be able to upload videos and provide contact information, mainly email to communicate with each other (possibly have a comment board).


Functional Details: 
•	Implement search, sort, and filter algorithms that will allow users to retrieve and view recipes by name, type, cook, or main ingredient(s).
•	Implement a real time cook assistance feature that will utilize timers and text to voice techniques to provide narration walkthroughs of cooking instructions.
•	Implement a recipe calculator that will allow users to enter a desired serving size and retrieve recommend ingredients quantities.
•	Implement ingredient locator feature that will allow users to search (ex. google) for ingredients and retrieve nearby store or web order options, brand, size and price.


Tools and Technologies: Visual Studio .Net (VB,C#), MySQL database,
